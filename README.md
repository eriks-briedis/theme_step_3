# Theme Step 3
A one file theme as a starting point for anyone who wants to start building themes for WordPress.

Splitting up the theme into multiple files.

The goal was to make the start a little simpler than the [\_s theme](http://underscores.me/)

On step three we take the theme to the next stage and introduce:

- a single view for posts
- sidebar with a widget area
- functions file for registering a widget area
